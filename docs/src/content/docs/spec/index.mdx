title: Specification Overview
description: REP formal specification documents — RFC, Security Model, and Conformance.
---

REP is defined by three specification documents. They are the authoritative reference for the protocol, its security properties, and its conformance requirements.

## Documents

| Document | Status | Version | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| [REP-RFC-0001](/spec/rfc-0001/) | Active | 0.1.0 | Core protocol specification — variable classification, gateway architecture, SDK API, wire format, deployment patterns |
| [Security Model](/spec/security-model/) | Active | 0.1.0 | Threat model, 7 threat analyses, hardening recommendations, known limitations |
| [Conformance](/spec/conformance/) | Active | 0.1.0 | Requirements for conformant gateway and SDK implementations |

## Versioning policy

The specification uses semantic versioning:

- **Patch** (0.1.x): Clarifications, typo fixes, non-normative additions
- **Minor** (0.x.0): New optional features, backwards-compatible extensions
- **Major** (x.0.0): Breaking changes to the wire format, API surface, or security model

The current version (0.1.0) indicates the specification is active and subject to refinement based on implementation experience. Breaking changes are possible before 1.0.

## License

Specification documents are licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Reference implementations (gateway, SDK, CLI, adapters) are licensed under [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

## JSON schemas

Machine-readable schemas are published for integration and validation:

- [Payload schema](/schema/rep-payload.schema.json) — validates the injected `<script>` JSON
- [Manifest schema](/schema/rep-manifest.schema.json) — validates `.rep.yaml` files
