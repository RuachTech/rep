description: Requirements for REP-conformant gateway and SDK implementations.
---

An implementation is **REP-conformant** if it satisfies the requirements below. This page is extracted from REP-RFC-0001 Section 11.

## Gateway conformance (MUST)

A conformant gateway implementation MUST:

1. Read only `REP_*` prefixed environment variables
2. Classify variables into exactly three tiers based on prefix (`PUBLIC`, `SENSITIVE`, `SERVER`)
3. Strip the classification prefix from variable names in the payload
4. Reject startup if variable names collide after prefix stripping
5. Run secret detection guardrails on PUBLIC tier variables
6. Inject a `<script id="__rep__" type="application/json">` block into HTML responses
7. Compute and include an HMAC-SHA256 integrity token
8. Encrypt SENSITIVE tier variables using AES-256-GCM
9. Issue single-use, time-limited session keys via `/rep/session-key`
10. Never transmit SERVER tier variables to the client under any circumstances

## Client SDK conformance (MUST)

A conformant SDK implementation MUST:

1. Read from `<script id="__rep__">` synchronously on import
2. Verify payload integrity on initialization (SRI hash)
3. Expose `get()` as a synchronous function
4. Expose `getSecure()` as an async function
5. Make no network calls during initialization
6. Freeze the public variable object to prevent mutation

## Optional features (MAY)

Conformant implementations MAY implement:

1. Hot reload via Server-Sent Events
2. Manifest file validation at startup
3. TypeScript type generation from manifest
4. Framework-specific adapters (React hooks, Vue composables, Svelte stores)
5. Codemod tooling for migration

## Notes

- "MUST", "SHOULD", and "MAY" follow [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119) conventions
- The reference implementation (gateway in Go, SDK in TypeScript) satisfies all MUST requirements and implements all optional features
- Alternative implementations need only satisfy the MUST requirements to be conformant
